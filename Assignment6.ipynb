    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are used to store data and give them a name for easy reference. To create variables in Python, you need to follow a few rules:\n",
    "\n",
    ".Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). They cannot start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    ".For example: name, _count, total_score\n",
    "\n",
    ".Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).\n",
    "\n",
    " For example: age, student_name, total_score_1\n",
    "\n",
    ".Variable names are case-sensitive. This means that myVariable and myvariable are considered as two different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    ".Python keywords cannot be used as variable names since they have special meanings in the language. For example, you cannot use if, for, while, or print as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    ".Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful. It's good practice to use variable names that reflect the purpose or content of the data they store. This enhances code readability and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    ".Avoid using built-in function or module names as variable names to prevent conflicts or confusion.\n"

    "Q.3. What are the standards and conventions followed for the nomenclature of variables in\n",
    "\n",
    "python to improve code readability and maintainability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are widely accepted standards and conventions for naming variables that help improve code readability and maintainability.Here are some key guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Use descriptive and meaningful names: Variable names should accurately reflect the purpose or content of the data they store.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps make your code more readable and self-explanatory. For example, instead of using single letters like x or y, use descriptive names like age, total_score, or is_valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Follow a consistent naming style: There are two main naming styles in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Camel Case: Start with a lowercase letter and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "myVariable, totalScore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snake Case: Use all lowercase letters and separate words with underscores. For example, my_variable, total_score.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to use snake case for variable names in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Avoid using single underscores at the beginning or end of variable names: Leading and trailing underscores have special meanings in Python, so it's best to avoid them in variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Be consistent with naming conventions: When working on a project, it's important to adhere to the existing naming conventions used in that project. Consistency helps make the codebase more readable and maintainable for all developers involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Use lowercase for built-in functions and module names: To differentiate variable names from built-in functions and module names, it's a convention to use lowercase for them. For example, use 'print()', 'len()', 'math.sqrt()'instead of 'Print()',\n",
    "\n",
    "'LEN()', 'Math.sqrt()'."

    "\n",
    "Escape sequences: The backslash is used to represent special characters within strings. For example:\n",
