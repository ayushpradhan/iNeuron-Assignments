    "Q.2 What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A string is a series of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.\n",
    "It is a data type that we want to store at a particular memory location.\n",
    "On the other hand a variable is reserved memory location to store values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.3 Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. 1.Numeric data type- Int,float,complex\n",
    "Int- It is a whole no which is positive or negative without decimals an it can have unlimitid length.\n",
    "eg x=1 \n",
    "\n",
    "Float-It is a decimal no which can be positive or negative.\n",

    "String is a series of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.\n",
    "eg a=\"Github\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Lists-They are used to store collection of data. List items are ordered,mutable and allow duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "List items can be of any data type.They are enclosed between square brackets [].\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Q.4 What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.A combination of operands and operators is called an expression.The expression in Python produces some value or result after being interpreted by the Python interpreter.For eg x=x+4\n",
    "In this expression first 4 is added to the variable x. After the addition is performed, the result is assigned to the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.5 What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Expressions can be assigned or used as operands, while statements can only be declared.\n",
    "\n",
    "for eg a=5 is a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "a=a+1 is an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions always returns a value while a statement never returns a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are also expressions. Even a non returning function will still return None value, so it is an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions can print a result while a statement cannot print any result."
