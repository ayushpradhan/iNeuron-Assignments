    "1)Robustness means that the software is able to handle unexpected inputs or errors gracefully.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "The purpose of the self parameter is to access and manipulate the instance variables and methods within the class. When a class method is called on an instance of a class, the instance is automatically passed as the first argument to the method, which is why self is used as the parameter name. By using self, you can refer to the instance and its attributes within the method.\n",
    "The other key points of self parameter are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing instance variables: With self, you can access and modify instance variables within the class methods. For example, self.variable_name refers to an instance variable, and you can assign values to it or access its value within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling other methods: self allows you to call other methods within the class. By using self.method_name(), you can invoke other methods and perform necessary actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating between instance variables and local variables: Using self distinguishes instance variables from local variables within the method. It clarifies that you are referring to the instance variables specific to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicitly passed by the interpreter: When you call a class method on an instance, you don't explicitly pass the self argument. The interpreter automatically handles it and passes the instance as the first argument to the method."
